            This chart is based on the Power Law Oscillator model for Bitcoin,
            which I made some tweaks to in order to make it more accurate based
            on recent price action. I have written an in-depth explanation of
            the article along with its code. If you're interested in diving

            It can be used as a tool that helps us understand if Bitcoin's price
            is too high or too low compared to its historical patterns. Think of
            it like a gauge. It looks at Bitcoin's current price and compares it
            to where it's expected to be "on average" based on past data. When
            the gauge is in the red zone, it might mean Bitcoin is getting
            overvalued, and selling could be a good idea. But when it's in the
            blue zone, it might be a good time to buy because Bitcoin could be
            undervalued.

              The Power Law Oscillator is a valuable tool and is relatively
              simple. It functions by comparing Bitcoin's actual price to a
              prediction derived from a linear regression line, resulting in an
              oscillator value representing the price difference. This
              oscillator value fluctuates within a specific range, typically
              between -1 and 1, with peaks aligning with market cycle highs.

            <p className='paragraph-padding'>
              The plot above shows at which percentile of the oscillator the
              price of Bitcoin lies at any given time. Blue regions are closer
              to the 10th percentile, while red regions are closer to the 90th
              percentile.
            </p>
            <p className='paragraph-padding'>
              It's important to note that the oscillator is not flawless and
              should not be the sole basis for investment decisions (don't sue
              me!)
